# [Statistics] Bernoulli Samples: Stripe [Medium]

Consider a Bernoulli random variable with parameter p. Say you observe the following samples: [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. What is the log likelihood function for p and what is the MLE of p?

## Answer

Bernoulli(p)

pmf = 1 - p , 0, p, 1

log likelihood = log(p^4*(1-p)) = 4log(p)+log(1-p)

the derivative of [4log(p)+log(1-p)] = 0

4/p + 1/1-p = 0

4-4p+p = 0 => p = 4/3

## Solution

### step one: get the formula of log likelihood for {x_1, ... , x_n} ,not stopping at n = 4

log_likelihood \proportion_to the product of log(p^(x_i) * (1-p)^(1-x_i)), i = 1,..,n

\proportion_to sum(x_i * log(p) + (1-x_i) * log(1-p)), i = 1 ,..., n

### step two: get the formula of MLE using derivative

derivative of log-likelihood regarding to p = sum(x_i)/p + (-1ï¼‰* sum(1-x_i)/(1-p) = 0

sum(x_i) - sum(x_i) * p - sum(1) * p + sum(x_i) * p = 0

n * p = sum(x_i)

p = sum(x_i) / n

estimate = 4 / 5
